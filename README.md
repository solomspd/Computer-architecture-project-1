This project is an implementation for the pipelined processor/datapath. It includes the five stages of the pipeline and a working forwarding unit.

This working implementation includes all RV32I instructions except for CRS and FENCE instructions.

The datapath features a single unified memory in place of two independant memory memories designated to instructions and data. The memory size is still 4Kbytes big.
